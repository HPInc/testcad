**Exhaustive testing** is [impossible](https://www.istqb.org/downloads/send/51-ctfl2018/208-ctfl-2018-syllabus.html). Rather than attempting to test exhaustively, risk analysis, **test techniques**, and priorities should be used to focus test efforts.

(_ISTQB Syllabus_).

#### Do you share [this vision ?](https://www.istqb.org/about-as/vision-mission.html)

### 1. Download testCAD 6.4.8


[![Windows](./assets/images/windows.png)](./bin/windows/testCAD32.6.4.8.zip)![spacer](./assets/images/spacer.png)[![Linux](./assets/images/linux.png)](./bin/linux/testCAD64.6.4.8.zip)


### 2. Picture your system

(Find the **example.spec** inside the **example** folder of the downloaded **.zip**)

- Component (Part of your system)
  - Module (Menu entry)
    - Module (Sub Menu entry _or test Variable_)
      - Element (Option _or test Value_)
      - Element (Option _or test Value_)
      - Element (Option _or test Value_)
    - Module (Sub Menu entry _or test Variable_)
      - Element (Option _or test Value_)
      - Element (Option _or test Value_)
      - Element (Option _or test Value_)

### 3. Explore and track your system
It is easy use the system hierarchical tree to make exploratory charters and extract variables to create _test Combinations_

Keep your tree up to date to spot:

*   Pending.
*   Validated.
*   Failed.
*   Needs clarification.
*   Not supported.

### 4. Measure
Track your system status and get quantitative data about its state.

### 5. Design tests

*   Orthogonal arrays (_matrixes_).
*   State-Transition N-1 switch.
*   Traceability matrixes.

### 6. Generate tests
Export tests and data from **testCAD** to html documents.

### 7. Upload tests
Upload tests **and design files** to a test management platform.

### 8. Maintain (_Review + Transfer + Adapt_) tests
If a test has the design data available it is easy to:

*  Execute
*  Find flaws
*  Transfer
*  Modify
*  Update

### 9. Improve testCAD
Nothing is perfect, let us know about a problem or a useful feature that would help to improve testCAD.

**_Your problem is potencially our next problem_** we are interested to know about it!

_Give us some time... testCAD is for free..._
